 * CZI-to-image
 * The following program uses the bioformats plugin in image J
 * and converts a CZI z-stack into individual images.
 * The motivation for this program was to create background-adjusted
 * images for the mmqt (microglia morphology quantification toolbox)
 * analysis. The following images are read by the mmqt.
